README for Linux Users

Desk Light Commander will work on linux with the proper permissions.  

First, ensure your user has access to the arduino port by running this command: 
sudo usermod -a -G dialout your_username

auto installs of the needed python packages do not yet work yet.  So use pip3 to install the following packages: 
pip3 install pyfirmata
pip3 install eel
